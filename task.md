# Refactoring SolTip Frontend with Privy Integration

## Project Overview
This project involves refactoring the SolTip frontend to integrate with new API endpoints and replace the previous wallet implementation with Privy. The refactoring aims to improve code readability, maintainability, and performance while ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Files Modified

### ✅ Types and API Client
- `client/src/types/index.ts`: Updated type definitions to match new API responses
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`: Updated API endpoint integration

### ✅ Context and Hooks
- `client/src/context/WalletContext.tsx`: Refactored to use Privy for wallet authentication
- `client/src/hooks/useWallet.ts`: Updated to integrate with the new context
- `client/src/hooks/useSocialAccounts.ts`: Fixed to work with the updated API
- `client/src/hooks/useTransactions.ts`: Refactored for better error handling and loading states

### ✅ Components
- `client/src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`: Added new component for loading states
- `client/src/utils.ts`: Added utility functions for common operations

### ✅ Pages
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Refactored to use new wallet context and loading states
- `client/src/pages/SendTip.tsx`: Updated to use new API endpoints and improved error handling
- `client/src/pages/WalletManagement.tsx`: Refactored to use Privy for wallet connections
- `client/src/pages/TransactionHistory.tsx`: Updated to display transaction history with better UX
- `client/src/pages/ConnectPlatforms.tsx`: Refactored to handle social platform connections with improved loading states

## API Integration
- Updated to use new API endpoints for all wallet operations
- Improved error handling for API requests
- Added proper loading states during API calls

## Authentication Flow
- Replaced the previous wallet implementation with Privy
- Updated the authentication flow to use Privy's hooks and methods
- Ensured seamless wallet connection and disconnection

## Key Changes
- Improved state management throughout the application
- Enhanced error handling with informative user messages
- Added loading states to improve UX during asynchronous operations
- Updated type definitions to match the new API responses
- Removed the ConnectWalletModal component and replaced it with direct Privy integration

## Future Work
- Further optimization of API calls
- Implement additional features based on new API capabilities
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Consider implementing route-based code splitting for better performance

## Developer Notes
- The new API returns data in a different format, so ensure all components are updated to handle this
- Privy authentication requires proper environment variables to be set
- Loading states are now managed through the Skeleton component
- Error handling should provide clear feedback to users
